<p><center><font size="6"></center>My name is Ariana Belen. I first discovered tiny homes when I was watching television and came across Tiny House Nation. Tiny House Nation
								   is a show with the builder, Zack, and the person who helps the future tiny housers prepare for living in a tiny home. This show opened my 
								   eyes and showed me that if I went in this direction that I wouldn't need to worry about paying for a big house, because I would have this 
								   tiny house. 
</p>
<p><center><font size="6"></center>I have always really been interested in helping the environment and making sure that we all have a small footprint on the earth. Tiny homes
								   have a smaller global footprint. Another thing that really drew me to tiny homes was the flexibilty. I have moved a lot of times in my 
								   lifetime and left my home behind. But with tiny homes, you can bring your home with you. You will never have to leave your home behind 
								   again (unless you decide to sell it).  
</p>

<p><center><font size="6"></center>I plan to begin building my tiny home very soon. So that I can live in it when I am in college. I plan to experiment living in different places 
								   that aren't necessarily tiny homes but are relatively tiny. For example, a westfalia camper van, a tear drop trailer, a little place that you
								   can pull with your bicycle, etc. I have always been drawn to small spaces but now I'm going to be living in them.

</p>

<p><center><font size="6"></center>I came up with the idea of making this website to show people that tiny really is the way to go. For the people that don't think that they
								   could go tiny, you can. It just comes down to how much stuff you really need. This website ties in the environment and tiny homes. It also shows
								   the benefits of living in tiny homes.
